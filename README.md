This project is a simplified web-based simulation of the IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) application. It provides basic functionalities such as user login/registration, train tracking with visual representation, and a train list display.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Basic login and registration functionalities (placeholder).
Train Tracking: Visual representation of train movement between stations, indicating on-time/late status, and arrival message.
Train List: Displays a static list of train numbers and routes.
Dynamic Routes: Station names change based on entered train number.
Responsive Design: Basic responsive design for different screen sizes.
Project Structure:

abc.html: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
abc.css: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for the application.
Setup Instructions:

Clone the Repository (Optional):

If you have the project in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:
Bash

git clone <repository_url>
Open abc.html:

Navigate to the project directory and open the abc.html file in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
Explore the Application:

You can now interact with the application:
Use the login/register buttons (placeholder functionality).
Enter a train number in the "Track Train" section and click "Track" to see the simulated train movement.
View the train list.
Navigate between pages using the "Back" buttons.
How to run the code:

Create Files: Create three files named abc.html, abc.css, and script.js in a single directory.

Copy Code: Copy the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into the respective files.

Open in Browser: Open the abc.html file with any web browser.

Project Limitations:

Placeholder Functionality: The login and registration functionalities are placeholders and do not interact with a real database.
Static Train Data: The train list and train routes are static and hardcoded in the JavaScript code.
Simplified Visuals: The train tracking visualization is a simplified representation of train movement.
No backend: This is a purely front-end application.
Potential Enhancements:

Implement Backend: Add a backend server with a database to handle user authentication and store train data.
Real-time Train Data: Integrate with a real-time train data API to display accurate train information.
Advanced UI/UX: Improve the user interface and user experience with better design and interactions.
Search Functionality: Add search functionality to find trains based on various criteria.
Booking Feature: Add a feature to simulate ticket booking.
